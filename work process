The first line, #include <stdio.h>, tells the compiler to include the standard input/output header file. This file contains declarations for functions such as printf() and scanf(), which are used to read and write data from the console.
The next line, int main(), defines the main function. This is the function that is called when the program starts running.
The next few lines declare the variables that will be used in the program. The variable operator is a character variable that will store the operator entered by the user. The variables num1 and num2 are double variables that will store the two numbers entered by the user. The variable result is a double variable that will store the result of the calculation.
The next line, printf("Enter an operator (+, -, *, /): ");, prints a message to the console asking the user to enter an operator.
The next line, scanf("%c", &operator), reads the operator entered by the user and stores it in the variable operator.
The next line, printf("Enter two numbers: ");, prints a message to the console asking the user to enter two numbers.
The next line, scanf("%lf %lf", &num1, &num2), reads the two numbers entered by the user and stores them in the variables num1 and num2.
